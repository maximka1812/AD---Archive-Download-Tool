## About 

There are many great books available on https://openlibrary.org/ and https://archive.org/, however, many of them need to be borrowed and you can only borrow them for 1 hour to 14 days and you don't have the option to download it as a PDF to read it offline or share it with your friends. I created this program to solve this problem and retrieve the original book in pdf format for FREE !

Of course, the download takes a few minutes depending on the number of pages and the quality of the images you have selected. You must also create an account on https://archive.org/ for the tool to work.


## Getting Started

Download zip archive with AD.exe and settings file from project Releases, make some folder and unpack ZIP archive you don't need to install anything else.
   
## Usage

Open ad.txt settings file in editor, read the comments and put your information in proper place.

Save settings file and run the tool, it'll pick up all new settings.

## Notes

Tool is based on Archive.org-Downloader original script with many feature additions
